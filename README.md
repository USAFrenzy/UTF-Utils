# UTF-Utils
A simple and small header-only helper for transcoding between UTF-16LE, UTF-32LE, and UTF-8. This includes the utilities for verifying valid unicode codepoints for the encoding as well as handling invalid codepoints by using a replacement character for that encoding instead of throwing.
